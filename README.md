# Shipstation-Locations
Changes the locations of Skus on the Shipstation platform
Change the Authentication key to your account Authentication key and run script. 
Allows you to quickly move inventory to new locations without having to use the website to save lots of time.
Skus must be present in system to work. If you want to set locations by putting inventory away that hasn't been logged in to the system yet then do a bulk cvs file of just the skus first so they're in the system.
